TO DO
---------------------
Figure out image storage protocols
	-store images in the uploads/sip-printify-manager/images/ directory when they are in the local images state.
	-when images are uploaded to printify, remove them from local storage.

NOTES - This function in new product creation is what needs to be fixed  for the create new product table to fill

   function init() {
        // Event listener for the 'Apply' button in the templates section
        $('#template-actions-apply').on('click', function() {
            const action = $('#template-actions-dropdown').val();
            const selectedTemplates = $('input[name="selected_templates[]"]:checked');

            if (action === 'create_new_products') {
                if (selectedTemplates.length === 0) {
                    alert('Please select at least one template.');
                    return;
                }

                // For simplicity, we'll use the first selected template
                selectedTemplateId = selectedTemplates.first().val();

                // Load the Product Creation Table
                loadProductCreationTable(selectedTemplateId);
            }

            // Handle other actions...
        });


-----------------------------------
OTHER CLEANUP

change save template related things to:
create_template
edit_template
save_template_edits

change #product-editor-save to template-editor-save

product-editor-header span to template-editor-header
search for other instances of product-editor

BUGS ANd ISSUES
---------------------
Issues with Template Editor
	-scrollbars are non interactive with mouse until after they are used with the scroll wheel.  They need to be mouse interactive immediately - when the scrollbar is clicked and drahhed, the actions pass through to the text window and click drag select rows of text



---------------------
IDEAS AND NOTES
---------------------

SCROLLBARS-----------
commenting out the scrollbar initialization line - scrollbarStyle: 'native', - has no effect - the scrollbar remains and is broken in the same way

If the issue is that the cm textareas initialize when the dom draws before they are visible with content, can the code be changed to draw them after mouseclick and after the window content has been created and initialized?

scroll/simplescrollbars.js
Defines two additional scrollbar models, "simple" and "overlay" (see demo) that can be selected with the scrollbarStyle option. Depends on simplescrollbars.css, which can be further overridden to style your own scrollbars.
scroll/annotatescrollbar.js
Provides functionality for showing markers on the scrollbar to call out certain parts of the document. Adds a method annotateScrollbar to editor instances that can be called, with a CSS class name as argument, to create a set of annotations. The method returns an object whose update method can be called with a sorted array of {from: Pos, to: Pos} objects marking the ranges to be highlighted. To detach the annotations, call the object's clear method.


CREATE PRODUCTS TABLE-----------

addition to creation table:
	Once a template has been selected, Create New Products has been executed and the table has opened, it should remain open until closed and persist through browser refreshes and sessions.
	template name appears centered just above the table
	on the same row registered to the right are three buttons: edit json, close, save
		The edit json button brings up the existing template editor overlay.  This already exists.  The code to bring it up is in the templateEditor.js file
				$('.edit-template-content').on('click', function () {
					var templateName = $(this).closest('tr').find('.template-name-cell').data('template-name');
					$('#template-editor-overlay').show().addClass('active');
					$('#template-editor-header span').text('Edit Template: ' + templateName);

					var formData = new FormData();
					formData.append('action', 'sip_handle_ajax_request');
					formData.append('action_type', 'template_action');
					formData.append('template_action', 'edit_template');
					formData.append('template_name', templateName);
					formData.append('nonce', sipAjax.nonce);

					$.ajax({
						url: sipAjax.ajax_url,
						method: 'POST',
						data: formData,
						processData: false,
						contentType: false,
						success: function (response) {
							if (response.success) {
								var content = response.data.template_content;

								// Initialize editors with content
								if (!descriptionEditor || !jsonEditor) {
									initializeEditors(content);
								} else {
									// If editors already exist, update their content
									var separatedContent = separateContent(content);
									descriptionEditor.setValue(separatedContent.html);
									jsonEditor.setValue(separatedContent.json);

									// Force refresh after updating content
									setTimeout(() => {
										descriptionEditor.refresh();
										jsonEditor.refresh();
									}, 0);
								}
							} else {
								alert('Error: ' + response.data);
							}
						},
						error: function (xhr, status, error) {
							alert('AJAX Error: ' + error);
						}
					});
				});

		The close button removes the selected template from the table.  If there are unsaved changes it prompts whether the user would like to save before closing.
		The save button saves changes reflected in the table to the template.json.  The table remains open for continued editing.



		This should be an advanced control in the settings tab or in the advanced controls tab of the sip printify manager plugin.  the sync button scans the images list for images that have tags that share the source product, then it scans the products list for products that have the same blueprint as the template with images that correspond to the tags in the images list.  It then updates the create product table with the products that have been identified.





	the template data is not editable in the table
	a radio button in the shape of a star appears at the left side of each image cell in the template.  This star designates the "main" image.  This is the image that is used as the thumbnail in the design cell.  By default it should be the first image in the front print location.  Each radio button should have a tooltip that says "choose main image".

add image meta data that includes plugin specific data associated with each image.
	tag: shows each template source product:print location that refers to the image.  (DO I NEED THIS?  OR CAN I DO WHAT I NEED TO DO JUST USING TEMPLATE DATA?)

add to template data:
	creations: arrays that include the sets of products that were created from the template (that share the same source product)
		each template's creations array will be updated each time the create product table is used to create a new product
		there will be a synchronize button next to the template name that will scan the existing products and update the create product table with the products that have been created using the same source product

select a template from the template table and click Create New Products
		create new product table is populated with the data from the template
			the first row shows the main template data
			subsequent rows show the data for each product in the template's creations array.
		the images in the image table are updated so that images used in the source product and in the creations are tagged with the variant title and print location where they are referred to in the template.
		the images action menu is populated with selections that refer to the various print areas in the template:
			the main pulldown is appended to include
				Create New Product Variant
				Add to Product Variant
			a second pulldown to the right of the first pulldown is created that includes the print locations in the template
				Main (if this is selected, the third pulldown doesn't appear)
				Front
				Print Location 2
				Print Location 3
				Etc
			if a print area is chosen in the second pulldown that has multiple images in it, a third pulldown appears with the number of images in the print area.
				image 1
				image 2
				image 3
				etc
			The user can create multiple product variants on new rows in the Product Creation Table easily by selecting any number of images, identifying where to put them in the variants and clicking execute.  For example, if the user selects 100 images and then in the pulldowns selects Create New Product Variant, Front, image 2, the Create New Product table will populate with 100 new rows that copy the template data, but with the selected images in the designated locations.

		a row is appended to the Product Creation Table that populates with all the data in the template with the following changes:
			The main front image is 





			a series of rows populate the table showing each of the designs that has been made for the product using that template
			the image table data is updated
				each image used in a product has a tag field that is updated with the print area in which the image is being used in the template.










For the next phase of development of the SiP Product Manager for Printify, a wordpress plugin for managing and creating Printify products with a woocommerce store, I am working on a section that will appear in the plugins main admin panel that I've been working on that draws on the images available in the plugin's images table and the available templates created from printify products (the images table and the templates table have already been implemented in the admin panel). This new section allows for the integration of the images and the template data along with custom data entry by the user into new product data in the form of product json files that can then be sent to Printify using its API calls to create new products.

This new section is called the Product Creation Table and occupies a full width section of the admin page underneath the previously implemented elements. It consists of a title below which is a header area below which is a table.

The header area contains controls for building new products.  The full range of controls is still being developed, but it will include controls that allow for the import and export of cvs data to help customize the new products being created.

The table area contains the specific data for each new product with each row representing one product.

This functionality needs to be built in a way that integrates into the existing codebase.  I expect that will include:
html structure that will need to integrate into the existing admin-page.php file
core code that will need to integrate into the existing sip-printify-manager.php file
specific code that will need to integrate into a new php file called creation-functions.php
javascript that will need to integrate into the sip-ajax.js javascript file
css that will need to integrate into the sip-printify-manager.css file

Here's the structure of the data hierarchy
/wp-content/plugins/
    ├── sip-plugins-core/
    └── sip-printify-manager/
        ├── assets/
        │   ├── css/
        │   │   └── sip-printify-manager.css
        │   └── js/
        │       └── sip-ajax.js
        ├── includes/
        │   ├── creation-functions.php     
        │   ├── image-functions.php     
        │   ├── shop-functions.php
        │   ├── product-functions.php
        │   └── template-functions.php
        ├── views/
        │   └── admin-page.php
        ├── sip-printify-manager.php
        └── README.md

I think the best way to approach this is to integrate the html into the admin-page.php so that it appears in the context of the plugin, and then to create new distinct php, css and js files without integrating them to make it easier to manage iteration and then once the feature is working, integrate with the rest of the plugin hierarchy.


--------------------------------

By the time they will be using the new product creator, the user will have registered their shop (which also populates a products table and an images table), added new images to the images table and created templates from the products.  The UI of the admin panel at this point will show the products table, the images table and the templates table.  Below them will be the section where the Create New Products table will go.  It will initially only have the title and perhaps a simple empty table with headers and a single empty row to indicate its utility.

The users experience creating a new product begins when they select a particular template in the already implemented templates section of the plugin admin ui, select the "create new product" action from the pulldown and click execute.

At this point the header controls and the table appear fully realized under the Product Creation Table header.

The data in the template json file is used to populate a new-product json file and certain elements are entered into the cells under the correct columns in the new product row of the New Products Table where the user can use the table and other customization functions (image drag and drop, csv import) to customize them.

--------------------------------

The elements needed to create a json that are present in the source template json include:

title				
description			
tags				
blueprint id			
print provider id		
variants			
	id
	price
	is_enabled
print areas			
	variant ids		
	placeholders
		position
		images
			id	
			name	
			type
			height
			width
			x
			y
			scale
			angle
options - colors
	id
	title
	colors
options - sizes
	id
	title


--------------------------------

The columns that appear in the New Product Creation Table are as follows:

Front Design | Title | Sizes | Colors | Description | Tags | Price | ... an appropriately named "X Design" column for each other print area in the template.  The X  associated with each print area will come from the "position" key associated with each individual image in the template.json "images" array.

The data in the columns represents the data in the New Product JSON and updates to the cells for each row should update the data in the new product json accordingly.

--------------------------------

The table is populated from the source template json file in the following manner (entries without notes are present in the new product json but are not user editable and so don't appear in the Product Creation Table):


Front Design			| A product may have multiple print areas each with multiple images arranged together to create the design that is printed there, but should nearly always have at least a Front design.  The front design comes first in our table headers because it is the most visually representative of the product.  The template for how the front design is presented in the table is also used later in the columns for the other print area designs.
				| The front design header should span however many images there are in the area with the front "position". the images should appear in columns under the header from left to right in the order the appear from top to bottom in the source array.  Each cell should contain a small 30x30 image thumbnail derived from the url in the "src" key with the image title centered beneath it. The thumbnail should be clickable and open up a lightbox with the image in it.

	| 						Front Design					|
	| image thumbnail	| image thumbnail	| image thumbnail	| image thumbnail	|	
	| image name		| image name		| image name		| image name		|	

	Each cell is drag/droppable from the images table (the images table has already been implemented in the admin page) 

	There's a reset icon button to the left of each image name that resets them individually and a reset button to the left of the Front Images header that resets them all.



title				| The title in the table is assembled in part from the template title and in part from the front image name.  The code should look up the front image name in the template, find its string in the title string (or the placeholder "[title]") and replace it with the image name of whatever image is in the front image cell whether that's pulled in from the template or the user enters or drags a new image into the image thumb or front image name cells of the table - the name should then be editable.  There should be a reset icon on the far right side of the name cell that will revert it to the template name with the current front image.

colors				| For all the ids in the colors array create a series of swatches in the "colors" table cell associated with that product.  The swatches are filled with the their associated color's hexadecimal value with rollover text that shows the associated color's title.

sizes				| For all the ids in the sizes array create a series of strings in the "sizes" table cell associated with that product.  For each size show "title" values separated by commas

description			| The description should populate from the template description.  The cell should only show the first 20 or 30 characters of the description followed by ellipsis.  There should be a document edit button on the far right side of the cell that brings up a text editor overlay using the same implementation used in the description editor already implemented in the code.  Next to the document edit button should be a reset icon that will revert it to the description in the source template.

tags				| The tags cell should be populated from the template and the cell should be editable.  There should be a reset button on the far right of the cell that reverts the contents of the cell back to the tags in the source template.

blueprint id			| does not appear in the table

print provider id		| does not appear in the table	

variants			| does not appear in the table

	id			| does not appear in the table

	price			| not quite sure how to implement this yet.  Perhaps to start it could just show the range of lowest to highest price shown in the template.

	is_enabled		| does not appear in the table

print areas			| appear in the template in the context of the design locations		

	variant ids		| does not appear in the table		

	placeholders
		position	| the solution for the "front" position has been included above.  Each additional position in the template should be structured in the same way and the associated headers, columns and data should be appended to the table in the order in which they appear in the template
		images		| images data is integrated as described above
			id	
			name	
			type
			height
			width
			x
			y
			scale
			angle




---------------------
FIXED
---------------------
	-the bottom right corner scaling handle is scaling the mdoal uniformly outward from the center of the window instead of just pulling the bottom right corner in and out.
	-removing the css "resize: both;" removes the handle
	-I might be wrong, but I don't think it's the CSS causing the corner handle to scale uniformly
	-Please refer to the original example code in which the handles all worked as expected to try to diagnose why and fix the corner handle resulting in uniform scaling.
		Fix was to take translate out of the css.
need to clean out the custom js corner scaling code (while making sure not break the separte divider scaling code) and just let the resize:both do the work
