next order of business for my plugin development is to get the template actions available through an action pulldown specifically for the template list working again. 

Current Functions available in the template action menu include

Delete Template
Rename Template
Edit Template

I will attach the current iteration of the template-functions.php 

Delete Template Code is currently not working.  Nothing is triggered,  There are no PHP errors. I would like to get this working again.

Rename Template is also not working, the rename window comes up but entering a name and clicking execute doesn't do anything to the target file.  I consider this to be a cumbersome and unorthodox renaming method and don't want to fix it.  I'd rather remove the current solution and have renaming be enabled by having a little pencil icon that appears when you hover over each row and that when clicked, activates the cell with name cell for editing.  Pressing enter or clicking elsewhere will execute the renaming.

Edit Template also does not work.  The way this was set up to work was that it would insert a text editor on the page under the template container with the contents of the selected template json to be edited.  I consider this to be a non-optimal solution based on how my plugin layout is evolving.  What I'd like to do instead is have a text editor open in a new window that pops up over the rest of the interface.  sort of the text equivalent of a lightbox.  The contents of the .json can be reviewed, edited and saved and then the window can be closed to return to the main manager dashboard.

I'd like to add the following additional actions to the action pop-up
Duplicate Template - creates a copy of the selected template/s and adds a numeric increment 001, 002
Create New Product - loads the template into the Create Product Table (this has yet to be designed. Details TBD)

Please let me know if there's any critical info missing.  To help you understand the code structure context I'm building in, here's the code file hierarchy.
